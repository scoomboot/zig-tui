# Zig TUI Library - Issue Tracker

## Project Overview

A modular, extensible Terminal User Interface (TUI) library in Zig following the Maysara Code Style (MCS) principles. The library emphasizes simplicity, performance, and beautiful code organization.

## ⚠️ Implementation Status Notice

## 🚨 Critical Implementation Path

These core issues must be fixed in dependency order to get a working TUI:

### Implementation Order (Respecting Dependencies):

1. **~~Complete ANSI Sequences (#005)~~** - Status: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Full implementation with all color modes and styles
   - 54 tests passing, performance targets met

2. **Complete Terminal Core** (#006) - Status: ⚠️ 50%
   - Add missing methods: `isRawMode()`, error types
   - Fix API consistency (snake_case vs camelCase)
   - Required by: size detection (#007), tests (#016)

3. **Implement Terminal Size Detection** (#007) - Status: ❌ 0%
   - Replace hardcoded 80x24 with actual ioctl/Windows API
   - Required by: screen rendering (#011), tests (#016)

4. **Implement Screen Rendering** (#011) - Status: ❌ 0%
   - Connect buffer to actual terminal output
   - Required by: any visual output

5. **Implement Keyboard Input** (#012) - Status: ⚠️ 30%
   - Replace placeholder `read_input()` with actual implementation
   - Required by: event loop (#014)

6. **Complete Event Loop** (#014) - Status: ⚠️ 40%
   - Finish `process_buffer()` implementation
   - Required by: interactive functionality

7. **Fix Terminal Tests** (#016) - Status: 🔄 Needs Refactor
   - Update tests to match actual API after #006 is complete
   - Or update implementation to match test expectations

## 🚀 Quick Start Implementation Guide

### What's Actually Working Now
✅ **Completed Components:**
- Raw mode implementation with cross-platform support and signal handling
- Main TUI entry point with atomic state management
- Screen buffer with double buffering and diff algorithm
- Basic ANSI escape sequence functions
- Directory structure and build configuration

### Minimum Required for Working Demo
To get a basic "Hello World" TUI demo running, complete these issues in order:

1. **Fix Terminal Core API** (#006) - 2 hours
   - Decide: snake_case or camelCase (recommend matching Zig stdlib: snake_case)
   - Add `is_raw_mode()` method
   - Add error types for proper error handling

2. **Implement Terminal Output** (#011) - 3 hours  
   - Connect screen buffer to terminal via ANSI sequences
   - Implement `flush()` to write buffer to terminal

3. **Basic Keyboard Input** (#012) - 2 hours
   - Implement minimal `read_input()` for Ctrl+C to exit
   - Can skip full key mapping initially

**Total Time: ~7 hours for minimal working demo**

### API Consistency Decision Required
**Current Conflict:** Tests use camelCase (`enterRawMode`) but implementation uses snake_case (`enter_raw_mode`)

**Recommendation:** Use snake_case throughout to match Zig standard library conventions:
- `enter_raw_mode()` not `enterRawMode()`
- `is_raw_mode()` not `isRawMode()`
- `get_size()` not `getSize()`

This requires updating terminal.test.zig to match.
