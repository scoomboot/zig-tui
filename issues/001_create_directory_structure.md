# Issue #001: Create MCS-compliant directory structure

## Summary
Set up the foundational directory structure for the TUI library following Maysara Code Style (MCS) conventions.

## Description
Create the base directory hierarchy for the TUI library. This structure will house all modules, tests, and utilities in a clean, MCS-compliant organization that supports modular development and clear separation of concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `lib/` directory at project root
- [ ] Create `lib/tui.zig` as main entry point
- [ ] Create module directories:
  - [ ] `lib/terminal/` for terminal abstraction
  - [ ] `lib/screen/` for screen buffer management
  - [ ] `lib/event/` for input event handling
  - [ ] `lib/widget/` for widget system (placeholder)
  - [ ] `lib/layout/` for layout management (placeholder)
- [ ] Create utility subdirectories:
  - [ ] `lib/terminal/utils/ansi/` for ANSI sequences
  - [ ] `lib/terminal/utils/raw_mode/` for raw mode handling
  - [ ] `lib/screen/utils/cell/` for cell representation
  - [ ] `lib/screen/utils/rect/` for rectangle utilities
  - [ ] `lib/event/utils/keyboard/` for keyboard input
  - [ ] `lib/event/utils/mouse/` for mouse input (future)
- [ ] Add `.zig` and `.test.zig` files for each module
- [ ] Verify directory structure matches MCS module organization rules

## Dependencies
- None (first issue)

```

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all directories are created
- Ensure each module has both implementation and test files
- Confirm structure follows MCS naming conventions
- Validate that placeholder files compile without errors

## Resolution Summary

### ✅ Issue Resolved

Successfully created the MCS-compliant directory structure for the TUI library with all required modules and utility subdirectories.

### Completed Actions:

1. **Directory Structure Created**
   - Created `lib/` root directory with complete hierarchy
   - All module directories: terminal/, screen/, event/, widget/, layout/
   - All utility subdirectories as specified in the implementation notes

2. **Implementation Files Created (23 files)**
   - Main entry point: `lib/tui.zig` with module exports
   - Core modules: terminal.zig, screen.zig, event.zig, widget.zig, layout.zig
   - Utility modules: ansi.zig, raw_mode.zig, cell.zig, rect.zig, keyboard.zig, mouse.zig
   - All files follow MCS conventions with proper headers and section demarcation

3. **Test Files Created (11 files)**
   - Comprehensive test files for all modules and utilities
   - Test naming follows convention: "category: Component: description"
   - Multiple test categories included (unit, integration, e2e, performance, stress)
   - Test constants defined in INIT sections

4. **Build Configuration Updated**
   - Modified build.zig to point to lib/tui.zig
   - Created temporary src/main.zig for executable build
   - All compilation errors fixed

5. **Verification Complete**
   - All files compile successfully
   - Build test passes: 5/5 steps succeeded
   - Structure matches MCS module organization rules

### Key Implementation Details:

- **MCS Compliance**: Every file follows Maysara Code Style exactly
  - Proper file headers with repo/docs/author info
  - Section demarcation using box-drawing characters (╔══ PACK ══╗, ╔══ CORE ══╗)
  - 4-space indentation within sections
  - snake_case naming convention

- **Module Features**:
  - Terminal: Raw mode support with termios handling
  - Screen: Double-buffered rendering with diff calculation
  - Event: Keyboard, mouse, resize, and focus event support
  - Widget: Vtable-based polymorphism for extensibility
  - Layout: Linear and grid layout systems

### Next Steps:
Ready for Issue #002: Setup build configuration (build.zig refinement) and subsequent implementation of core functionality.
